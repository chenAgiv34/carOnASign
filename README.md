This project involves the development of an advanced smart car system equipped with sensitive and advanced sensors capable of detecting obstacles in its path and automatically stopping to prevent accidents. Additionally, the system is equipped with an internet-connected camera that allows the user to view the road in real time and control the car remotely through a user-friendly web interface.

Each journey can be tracked and documented via the camera, which provides a clear view of the route and potential obstacles. The web interface allows for full control of the car's movement, including the ability to stop immediately in case of danger detection. The system is designed to be easy to use and efficient in all terrains.

When an obstacle is detected, the system stops the car immediately and alerts the user through the web interface. The decision to stop is made automatically based on the data received from the sensors, ensuring a quick and accurate response. The user can then inspect the surroundings using the built-in camera and decide whether to continue moving or change the route using the directional arrows.

The development of this system is intended to improve the experience of using a remote-controlled car, ensuring maximum safety and providing full control to the user at any moment. This system combines advanced technology, safety, and ease of use, offering a perfect solution for smart and safe driving.
